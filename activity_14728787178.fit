If you’re new to racing or looking to set a new personal best, a running pace calculator can help. This tool helps determine how fast you’ll need to run to hit your goal time. The pace calculator will also provide you with split times, which are intermediate times to hit along the way. These help you know you’re on track to your goal.","answer_2":"Running pace calculators don’t account for changes in pace due to fatigue, course conditions or hills. With our free running pace calculator, you can see how someone with your paces will perform on any given distance."},"faq_4":{"question":"What is a good time to run a 5K race?","answer_1_mobile":"Most 5K race organizers report an average finish time of approximately 30 minutes for male runners and 36 minutes for female runners. Of course, these averages vary with age and running experience. If you’re setting out to run your first 5K race, don’t put too much pressure on time. Focus on finishing the race, or running the entire length of the course without stopping. After you’ve got a few races in your legs, you’ll have fun challenging yourself to get faster.

Our running pace calculator also works as a marathon pace chart so check out the pace calculator above to see the split times you’ll need to hit along the way."},"faq_6":{"question":"How do I read the marathon pace chart?","answer_1":"Because our running pace calculator displays split times, it is also effective as a marathon pace chart. Based on your pace, a marathon pace chart tells you the exact time you’ll pass each mile or kilometer marker during a marathon. For example, if you plan to run 9:00 minute miles (5:37 per km), you’ll pass mile 10 in 1:30:00, the halfway point in 1:57:59, then cross the finish line in 3:55:58.

If you’re new to racing or looking to set a new personal best, a running pace calculator can help. This tool helps determine how fast you’ll need to run to hit your goal time. The pace calculator will also provide you with split times, which are intermediate times to hit along the way.

Focus on finishing the race, or running the entire length of the course without stopping. After you’ve got a few races in your legs, you’ll have fun challenging yourself to get faster.

Based on your pace, a marathon pace chart tells you the exact time you’ll pass each mile or kilometer marker during a marathon. For example, if you plan to run 9:00 minute miles (5:37 per km), you’ll pass mile 10 in 1:30:00, the halfway point in 1:57:59, then cross the finish line in 3:55:58.
